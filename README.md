# Async Python for Complete Dummies
## (No offence intended: I too am a dummy!)

Like many people, I've often struggled with Python's async style. Here is
a collection of programs, which are intended to serve as 'cheatsheets', or quick reference guides
for the different subject areas.
I might update these from time-to-time, as a learn more. 

The two most helpful articles I've found so far are: 

- [Python Asynchronous Programming Fundamentals](https://jwodder.github.io/kbits/posts/pyasync-fundam/)
- [Waiting in asyncio](https://hynek.me/articles/waiting-in-asyncio/)

And of course: 

 - [Coroutines and Tasks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html)
